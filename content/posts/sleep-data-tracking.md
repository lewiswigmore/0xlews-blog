# Sleep Data Tracking

## Analysing My First Night of Sleep with Apple Watch

I recently decided to track my sleep using my Apple Watch (Series 10) because I thought it would be interesting. I plan to compare this data to my average sleep health in 3 months to see any progress. Here's a breakdown of my sleep stages and a comparison to optimal sleep ratios.

### My Sleep Data:

- **Time Slept**: 01:09 AM - 08:01 AM
- **Total Sleep Time**: 6 hours 52 minutes

#### Breakdown:
- **REM Sleep**: 1 hour 42 minutes (24.76%)
- **Core Sleep (Light Sleep)**: 4 hours 25 minutes (64.32%)
- **Deep Sleep**: 36 minutes (8.74%)
- **Awake**: 9 minutes (2.18%)

### Optimal Sleep Ratios:
- **REM Sleep**: 20-25%
- **Core Sleep (Light Sleep)**: 50-60%
- **Deep Sleep**: 15-20%
- **Awake**: Less than 10%

### Observations:

- **REM Sleep**: My REM sleep ratio is within the optimal range. REM sleep is when dreaming happens, and it's important for memory and learning, so that's a plus.
- **Core Sleep (Light Sleep)**: My core sleep ratio is a bit on the high side. Light sleep is necessary for body maintenance, but having too much might mean I'm missing out on deeper, more restorative sleep.
- **Deep Sleep**: My deep sleep ratio is below the optimal range. Deep sleep is the most restorative phase, crucial for physical restoration. I'd like to get more of this to feel more refreshed.
- **Awake**: My awake time is minimal and well within the optimal range, so it seems like my sleep was quite undisturbed, which is good.

While last night's sleep didn't feel amazing, I think taking averages over the course of three months will give a more accurate picture of my sleep health. Plus, I've already started actively making some changes, like actively avoiding YouTube on my phone before bed. Keeping consistent and tracking my sleep will hopefully show some progress and help me get better rest over time. It's going to be interesting to see the results in a few months' time.

## The Apple Watch Bedtime Experience

I also found the bedtime feature quite interesting. I was able to change my phone lock screen, appearance, layout, and notifications. The same customisations are available for my watch too. The morning alarm on the wrist was also less invasive than a loud alarm; it felt like I gradually woke up instead of being suddenly jolted awake.

There's a chance that this feeling might be due to the novelty of having a different experience for the first time, but it did feel nice. Additionally, because it's new to me, I found myself overthinking more before sleeping, likely because I knew my data was being tracked. This might affect the accuracy of the initial results. Studies have shown that knowing you're being observed can sometimes change your behavior, a phenomenon known as the observer effect. Over time, as I get used to this new routine, it's likely that this effect will diminish, leading to more accurate and representative data.
